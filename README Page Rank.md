# Page Ranking Algorithm
It is a link analysis which assigns to every node in
the web graph a numerical score between 0 and 1.
The PageRank of a node will depend on the link structure of the web graph.

>### HOW TO RUN?
<b>Input.txt:</b>

First Line includes the Number of nodes.<br>
Second Line includes the Number of Edges in the graph.<br>
From third line onwards we give the edges in the form of(source,destination).<br>

<b>The following are printed :</b> 
*  Transition Matrix without Teleportation.
*  Page Rank vector using Linear Algebra Method.
*  Page Rank vector using Iterative Method.
*  Transition Matrix with Teleportation.
*  Page Rank vector using Linear Algebra Method.
*  Page Rank vector using Iterative Method.


<b>Note: </b>
* We considered the graph as 1-based index means node number starts from 1 not 0.<br>
* Now we just need to run the HitsAlgo.ipynb file <br>
* Input file name is <b>input.txt</b> and file is present in the <b>same folder</b>.
